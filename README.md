# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository provides an overview of **Requirement Analysis** in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).  
It explains key activities, types of requirements, use case diagrams, and acceptance criteria ‚Äî all crucial steps to ensure that software projects are clearly defined and meet stakeholder expectations.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a critical phase in the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines what a software system should do and how it should perform.

It helps ensure that all stakeholders ‚Äî developers, clients, and end-users ‚Äî have a shared understanding of the system requirements before design and development begin.
## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is essential because it:

1. **Provides Clarity and Understanding**  
   It ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of project goals and expected functionalities.

2. **Defines the Project Scope**  
   Helps prevent scope creep by setting clear boundaries on what the system will and will not do.

3. **Lays the Foundation for Design and Development**  
   Serves as a roadmap for developers and designers, ensuring that the system is built according to user needs.

4. **Improves Cost and Time Estimation**  
   Helps in accurately estimating project effort, cost, and duration.

5. **Enhances Product Quality**  
   Leads to the development of a reliable product that meets user expectations.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements ‚öôÔ∏è
Functional requirements describe **what the system should do**.

**Examples (for a Booking Management System):**
- Users can **search for available properties** by location, price, or date.
- Users can **register and log in** securely.
- Admins can **manage property listings** (add, update, or delete).
- The system allows users to **book properties** and **receive confirmation emails**.

### Non-Functional Requirements üõ°Ô∏è
Non-functional requirements describe **how the system should perform**.

**Examples:**
- **Performance:** Pages should load within 2 seconds.
- **Security:** User data must be encrypted and protected from unauthorized access.
- **Usability:** The system must be easy to navigate and user-friendly.
- **Scalability:** The platform should handle increased traffic without performance degradation.
- **Reliability:** The system should have 99.9% uptime.


## Use Case Diagrams

**Definition:**  
Use Case Diagrams visually represent how users (actors) interact with the system to achieve specific goals.

**Actors:**
- Guest
- Registered User
- Admin

**Use Cases:**
- Search Property
- Register/Login
- Book Property
- Manage Listings

**Benefits of Use Case Diagrams:**
- Provides a clear overview of system functionalities.
- Helps identify and organize system requirements.
- Facilitates better communication between stakeholders and developers.

## Acceptance Criteria 

**Definition:**  
Acceptance Criteria are specific conditions that a software feature must meet to be accepted by stakeholders.

**Importance:**
- Ensures that all parties agree on what ‚Äúdone‚Äù means.
- Provides a measurable basis for testing.
- Improves software quality and user satisfaction.

**Example (Checkout Feature - Booking System):**
- Users can proceed to checkout only after selecting a property and available dates.
- The system should calculate the total amount including taxes and display it before confirmation.
- Users must receive a confirmation email within 2 minutes after successful payment.
